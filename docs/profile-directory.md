# Profile Directory

Sketchy Maze stores your user-created levels and custom doodads in your
operating system's profile directory for your account.

This will typically be found at the following locations based on your platform:

* **Windows:** `%APPDATA%` or `C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\doodle`
* **Mac OS:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/doodle`
* **GNU/Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/doodle` or `$HOME/.config/doodle`
* **Linux (Flatpak):** `$HOME/.var/app/com.sketchymaze.Doodle/config/doodle`

## Opening your Profile Directory

The in-game Settings window has a button that will open your Profile Directory
in your operating system's default file browser. You will see the folders
labeled "levels" and "doodads" which is where your custom created content will
live.

To install custom content created by other players, copy them into these folders.
