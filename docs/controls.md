# Controls

**Sketchy Maze** currently uses a mouse and keyboard for inputs, but eventually
will be usable from gamepad controllers, especially if it branches out and
targets platforms other than desktop computers in the future.

## During Gameplay

While playing a level, the following keys are used to control the player character:

* **Left** and **Right** arrow keys move the player left or right.
* **Up** arrow to make the player jump.
* **Space Bar** is used to "activate" certain doodads. Currently, only the
  [Warp Doors](doodads.md#warp-doors) require deliberate activation; Buttons and
  Switches activate _automatically_ when the player character (or other mobile
  doodad) touches them.

## Hotkeys

See the [Hotkeys](hotkeys.md) page for shortcut keys, especially around the
Level Editor feature.
